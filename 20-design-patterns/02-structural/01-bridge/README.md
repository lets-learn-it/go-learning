# Bridge

- It lets you split a large class or a set of closed related classes into two separate hierarchies - abstraction and implementation - which can be developed independently of each other.
- Bridge is usually designed up-front, letting you develop parts of an application independently of each other. On the other hand, Adapter is commonly used with an existing app to make some otherwise-incompatible classes work together nicely.
- With Adapter you access an existing object via different interface. With Proxy, the interface stays the same. With Decorator you access the object via an enhanced interface.

## Summary

- Decouple abstraction from implementation
- Both can exist as hierarchies
- Stronger form of encapsulation
