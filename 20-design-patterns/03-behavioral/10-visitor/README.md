# Visitor

- Lets you separate algorithms from objects on which they operate
- It suggests that you place the new behavior into a separate class called *visitor*, instead of trying to integrate it into existing classes.
- The original object that had to perform the behavior is now passed to one of the visitorâ€™s methods as an argument, providing the method access to all necessary data contained within the object.
