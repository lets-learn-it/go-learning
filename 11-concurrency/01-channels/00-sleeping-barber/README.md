# Sleeping Barber

- Introduced by Dijkstra in 1965
- A barbershop with waiting room with fixed number of seats
- If no one is in waiting room, barber goes to sleep
- When client shows up, if there are no seats available, he or she leaves
- If there is seat available, and barber is sleeping, the client wakes the barber upand gets a hair cut
- It the barber is busy, the client takes a seat and waits his or her turn
- Once the shop closes, no more clients are allowed, but the barber has to stay until everyone who is waiting gets hair cut.
