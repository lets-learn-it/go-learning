# Solid Principles

## Single Responsibility Principle

>class or method should have only one responsibility and only one reason to change.

## Open-Closed Principle

>software entities like class, modules, functions etc., should be able to extend a class behaviour without modifying it. Separates existing code from modified code to provide better stability, maintainability and minimizes changes in code.

## Liskov Substitution Principle

>Objects ond a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking the application.

## Interface Segregation Principle

>no code should be forced to depend on methods it does not use. Means that we should break larger interfaces into smaller ones.

## Dependency Inversion Principle

> high level modules should not depend on low level modules; both should depend on abstractions. In simple words, high level modules should depend on abstractions rather than concrete implementations.
